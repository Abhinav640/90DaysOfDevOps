1. What is Git and why is it important?

Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your source code and collaborate with other developers efficiently.
It is important for the following reasons.

a. **Version Control:** Git tracks changes to your source code over time, allowing you to see the complete history of modifications, who made them, and why.

b. **Collaboration:** Git facilitates collaboration among developers. Multiple team members can work on the same project simultaneously, with changes being merged together seamlessly.

c. **Branching and Merging:** Git's branching and merging capabilities are powerful features that enable developers to work on separate features or bug fixes in isolation. Branches can be created for specific tasks and then merged back into the main codebase once they're complete.

2. What is difference Between Main Branch and Master Branch??

Main and master both refer to the same primary branch. Previously the primary branch was called "Master" however because of its racial factors it was changed to "Main".
